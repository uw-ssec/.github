# Welcome to SSEC's GitHub Organization

The Scientific Software Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Washington works with researchers across various disciplines to build robust software that bolsters inquiry and builds community. The resulting tools are open source and reusable, designed to sustain discovery beyond SSECâ€™s involvement in the projects.
